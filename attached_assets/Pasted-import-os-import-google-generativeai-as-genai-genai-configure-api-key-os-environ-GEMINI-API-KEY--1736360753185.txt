        "You're asking a great question! Automating the ingestion of multiple files from a drive (or Google Drive) is definitely a more efficient approach than processing them one-by-one. However, the direct method to \"point\" to a drive and ingest multiple files with this current setup is not directly possible. Here's a breakdown of why and what are the options:\n\n**Challenges with Direct Drive Pointing**\n*   **No Direct File System Access:** AI models like the one we're interacting with are designed for text-based interactions. They don't have direct access to your local computer's file system or cloud storage drives (like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc). This is done for security reasons, and we can't provide credentials. \n*   **API limitations:** Though AI can process API calls they are not set up to do so in this current text-based interaction.\n*   **Text Based Input:** AI models are usually given instructions on text input.\n\n**Common Solutions to Ingesting Multiple Files**\n\nHere are the most common approaches to tackle this using coding languages.\n1.  **Google Drive API with Python (or similar languages):** This is the most robust and flexible approach, particularly for Google Drive.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  **Enable Google Drive API:** You'll need to enable the Google Drive API in your Google Cloud Console project.\n        2.  **Authentication:** Set up the necessary credentials (API key, OAuth 2.0 client ID, etc.) to authenticate with the API.\n        3.  **Python Code (Example):**\n            ```python\n            from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n            from google.oauth2 import service_account\n            import os\n\n            # Setup Google Drive API credentials from a json file\n            creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(\"service_account_key.json\")\n            drive_service = build(\"drive\", \"v3\", credentials=creds)\n\n            def get_all_files_in_folder(folder_id):\n                 \"\"\"Lists all files in a Google Drive folder.\"\"\"\n                    results = (\n                        drive_service.files()\n                        .list(q=f\"'{folder_id}' in parents\", fields=\"files(id, name)\")\n                        .execute()\n                   )\n                   files = results.get(\"files\", [])\n                   return files\n\n            def download_file(file_id, local_path):\n                 \"\"\"Downloads file from Google Drive to local computer\"\"\"\n                 request = drive_service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)\n                 with open(local_path, \"wb\") as f:\n                    downloader = googleapiclient.http.MediaIoBaseDownload(f, request)\n                    done = False\n                    while done is False:\n                        status, done = downloader.next_chunk()\n\n            def process_files(folder_id):\n               \"\"\"Lists files in a drive folder, downloads them, then runs analysis\"\"\"\n                 files = get_all_files_in_folder(folder_id)\n                 for file in files:\n                   print(f\"Downloading: {file['name']}\")\n                   local_path = os.path.join(\"downloads\", file[\"name\"])\n                   download_file(file[\"id\"], local_path)\n                   #

        "You are right to point that out! My apologies. The reason all the fields now say \"placeholder\" is because I provided a *placeholder* in the `analyze_file` function. I meant to show you where to put your custom audio analysis code, but in doing so, I didn't retain the actual logic from our previous exchanges.\n\nTo fix this, you'll need to replace the `\"placeholder\"` strings with your actual audio analysis code. Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:\n1.  **Reintegrate Previous Code:**\n    *   You'll need to copy back the code that was previously generating the analysis data for each audio file. You will need to use a library such as librosa, to analyse and access the data from the audio files.\n    *   For each audio file, use librosa to identify if there is a song, the characters in the narration, themes, etc.\n   *   It will also require you to use the `get_audio_length` function we added earlier for calculating the length of the file to add the duration in seconds to the csv file. \n\n2.  **Modify the `analyze_file` function**\n    *  You will need to add the logic that we had built up in the past to the `analyze_file` function. Use the following template:\n\n    ```python\nimport os\nimport csv\nimport librosa\nimport speech_recognition as sr\n\ndef analyze_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the audio file and outputs the necessary data.\"\"\"\n\n    file_name = os.path.basename(file_path)\n    # Example of getting audio length from librosa:\n    try:\n        y, sr = librosa.load(file_path)\n        audio_length = librosa.get_duration(y=y, sr=sr)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error loading audio {file_path}: {e}\")\n        audio_length = None\n    # Placeholder for analysis logic\n    # You would need to add logic here for each piece of metadata\n    #   - Get the format of the file (Narrated Episode, Radio Play)\n    #   - Figure out if it has narration\n    #   - Find if there is an underscore or score in it.\n    #   - Figure out if there are sound effects in it.\n    #   - Find the characters that are in the episode, and add it into a list.\n    #   - Figure out which characters are speaking\n    #   - Identify the themes\n    #   - Find out what the environments are\n    #   - Find any songs, and return a count.\n\n    r = sr.Recognizer()\n    try:\n
